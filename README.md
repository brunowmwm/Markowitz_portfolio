## About this project

The objective of this project was to reconstruct a Finance 2 subject activity. I was somewhat displeased with the work I had sent initially, so I decided to optimize the code in a way that I could calculate the Markowitz portfolio optimization automatically, choosing any (and how many) stocks I would like.

Also, by creating a code that could adapt itself accordingly to a number of stocks who doesn't need to be previously set, I got to learn more about loops and the .format() function.

## Some observations

I really liked this project code compared to the first one (https://github.com/brunowmwm/mn-vol-corr-and-normality), although I'll have to admit that I took a long time (too long), to discover the best weights for the portfolio. A mistake that was corrected after (almost) 2 minutes by a teacher. Well...guess I've learned to ask first.

## Functionalities:

This code will help you to:
- Discover the Markowitz portfolio optimization to any (and how many) assets you wish to.
- Discover the weights of each asset in a portfolio to get the best sharpe ratio

## Logbook:

### Day 1 - 2022/04/26

A: I started the project.

B: Decided to create the code in a way that it would adapt itself according to any assets (or number of them).

### Day 2 - 2022/05/01

A: The code kept being built.

B: Started to learn plotly so I could more visually appealing graphs.

### Day 3 - 2022/05/06

A: The code is almost finished.

B: I got an error to discover the best portfolio weights and couldn't find a solution.

### Day 4 - 2022/05/10

A: A tip from a teacher got the solution I was searching for.

B: Finished.
